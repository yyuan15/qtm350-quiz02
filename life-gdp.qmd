# Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita

## Introduction
The relationship between **life expectancy** and **GDP per capita** is crucial in understanding global economic development and public health. Generally, higher GDP per capita is associated with **longer life expectancy**, as wealthier countries tend to invest more in healthcare, education, and quality of life improvements.

## **Data Visualization**
Below is a scatter plot (@fig-plot) showing the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy using the **Gapminder dataset**.

```{python}
#| label: fig-plot
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "ife Expectancy and GDP per Capita"

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("gapminder.csv")

# Select relevant columns and drop missing values
df = df[['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy']].dropna()

# Scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(x=df['gdp_per_capita'], y=df['life_expectancy'])
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.title("Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy")
plt.xscale("log")  # Log scale for better visualization
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Findings:**

* The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy, with a logarithmic scale applied to GDP per capita for better visualization.

* Countries with higher GDP per capita generally have higher life expectancy.

* The increase in life expectancy slows down at higher income levels, meaning wealthier nations gain smaller health benefits from additional economic growth.
