# Country Analysis: Spain

## **Introduction**
Spain has undergone significant economic and social changes over the years. This analysis explores how **life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population** have evolved in Spain from **1952 to 2007** using the **Gapminder dataset**.

## **Data Visualization**
Below is a graph (@fig-plot) showing how Spain's **life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population** changed over time.

```{python}
#| label: fig-plot
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Spain"

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("gapminder.csv")

spain_data = df[df["country"] == "Spain"]

# Create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(8, 12))

# Plot Life Expectancy
axes[0].plot(spain_data["year"], spain_data["life_expectancy"], color="blue", marker="o")
axes[0].set_title("Spain: Life Expectancy Over Time")
axes[0].set_xlabel("Year")
axes[0].set_ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
axes[0].grid(True)

# Plot GDP per Capita
axes[1].plot(spain_data["year"], spain_data["gdp_per_capita"], color="green", marker="s")
axes[1].set_title("Spain: GDP per Capita Over Time")
axes[1].set_xlabel("Year")
axes[1].set_ylabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
axes[1].grid(True)

# Plot Population
axes[2].plot(spain_data["year"], spain_data["population_millions"], color="red", marker="d")
axes[2].set_title("Spain: Population Over Time")
axes[2].set_xlabel("Year")
axes[2].set_ylabel("Population (Millions)")
axes[2].grid(True)

# Adjust layout
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Findings:**

* Life Expectancy
    + Spain has seen a steady increase in life expectancy, rising from around 65 years in 1952 to over 81 years by 2007.
    + This trend indicates improvements in healthcare, sanitation, nutrition, and overall living conditions over time.

* GDP per Capita 
    + GDP per capita increased significantly from under $5,000 in 1952 to over $30,000 in 2007.
    + The steepest growth occurred after 1980, suggesting economic expansion, industrialization, and stronger integration into the global economy (e.g., Spain joining the EU in 1986).

* Population Growth
    + Spain's population grew consistently from about 28 million in 1952 to over 40 million by 2007.
    + The most rapid growth happened between 1950-1980, after which the rate of increase slowed down, possibly due to declining birth rates and economic shifts.
